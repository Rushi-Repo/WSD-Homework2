## Page Content

### 1. Dot Com Bubble :

  1. Silicon chip or Moore law (coined by Intel co-founder) - based on
     the law that the speed and power of integrated circuit doubles
     every eight months, making the process auto-catalytic. This made
     transistors smaller and smaller and thus computers as well.
  2. Metcalfe law (founder of Ethernet)- it states that every new node
     added to the network doesn’t just increases the network value by
     plus one, the curve is much steeper than that. This is the law of
     connectivity.
  3. Public key cryptography was introduced for online shopping initializing a
     secure e-commerce.
  4. 2004- Facebook goes online marking the beginning of the social
     networking era.
     
### 2. Communications

  1. Digg- founded by Kevin Rose and Jay Adelson
  2. YouTube- co founder- Chad Hurley (in 2005)
  3. Slogan- broadcast yourself
  4. Provided each and every one with broadcast power
  5. Facebook – founded by Mark Zukerberg
  6. Initial idea- mapping out the relationships people have.
  7. Concept of social graph for social network analysis
  8. 2001- Napster – founded by Shawn Fanning
  9. Introducing peer-to-peer system

      out a way to stop users from sharing copyrighted material before it
      can go back online.
  11. 2003- The blog publishing platform Word Press was launched.

### 3. Emerging Branches

  1. Information shared using bits (binary code)
  2. Bandwidth- maximum transmission capacity of device measured by
     bitrate
  3. Latency- time taken for bit to travel from sender to receiver.
  4. Sources of transmission:
    1. Fiber optic cable (expensive)
    2. Copper cable
    3. Radio signals (wireless)
  5. Wi-Fi- wireless fidelity- connected to ISP (internet service provider)-
     further to billions of devices and hundreds of networks
  6. IP address- each number represented in bits
    1. Traditional IP- 32 bits
    2. 1973- IPv4- with more than 4 billion devices
    3. Recent- IPv6- 128 bits with over 340 unidecillion addresses
  7. DNS (domain name system)- in this the servers are connected to
     distributed hierarchy
  8. Router- keeps track of the path of the data packets
  9. TCP- it manages the sending and receiving of all data packets.
  10. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)- it tells the web browser that how
     a page looks.
    1. The texts are mentioned direct as plain texts.
    2. The pictures and videos are individually requested using specific
       URL’s.
