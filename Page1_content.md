### 1. Introduction : 

INTERNET - It is the worldwide network of interconnected networks, which
together carry various information and services and also support the interlinked
web pages of World Wide Web.
The internet wasn’t invented initially but had predecessors like NPL network and
ARPANET. There was a traditional circuit switching method where networks
would interconnect at the circuit level, passing individual bits along end to end
circuit between a pair of end locations.

### 2. Origins

  1. 1961- Leonard Kleinrock wrote about ARPANET (Advanced Research
     Projects Agency Network).
  2. 1969- precursor of internet was jumpstarted in computing history with
     US Defense Department’s ARPANET
  3. 1974- The first Internet Service Provider (ISP) was born with the
     introduction of TELENET (commercial version of ARPANET).
  4. During following years, computers were added quickly to the
     ARPANET.
  5. Work proceeded on functionally complete Host to Host protocol
      and other network software.
  6. Initial concepts of internet:
  7. The beginning was with packet switching network followed by
     packet satellite networks and packet radio networks.
  8. Packet switching- more efficient than traditional switching method
     because of special purpose interconnection arrangements between
     networks.
  9. Time shared computers were connected with mini computers
     (acted as interface message processor).

  10. Transmission control protocol (TCP) and internet protocol (IP)
  11. host computer – outside the network
  12. host packets- connected through gateway
  13. 1982- TCP/IP emerged as a universal protocol for common
      network of interconnected networks.
  14. 1987- Number of hosts on internet exceeds 20,000.
  15. 1990- Tim Berners-Lee developed hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
      and further introduced the World Wide Web. This led to the enormous
      web growth.
      
### Browser wars 

  1. 1993- Marc Andreesen developed Mosaic Web Browser at University of
     Illinois
  2. 1994- Business venture- NETSCAPE was born with its browser named
     Navigator.
  3. Bill Gates- founder of Microsoft Cooperation
  4. Vision- a PC on every desktop, home and office running on
     Microsoft
  5. 1996- The browser war- between the major players Microsoft and
     Netscape heats up.
iii. Launched the browser of its own- Internet Explorer
